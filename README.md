## Project 1
This was an exercise in analyzing US census data from 1994 to predict an individuals' income. Three models were created (GaussianNB, SVC, Adaboost) and compared to see which would be the most effective based on their accuracy and fbeta score.

## Project 2
This was an exercise in determining if a company should buy an image classification model, or create their own from scratch. A Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) was created from the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) image dataset and was evaluated.
