## Project 1
This was an exercise in analyzing US census data from 1994 to predict an individuals' income. Three models were created (GaussianNB, SVC, Adaboost) and compared to see which would be the most effective based on their accuracy and fbeta score.

## Project 2
This was an exercise in determining if a company should buy an image classification model, or create their own from scratch. A Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) was created from the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) image dataset and was evaluated.

## Project 3
This was an exercise using real world data from a German mail-order sales company. Data was preproccessed by encoding categorical values and imputing any missing values. Following preproccessing data was explored through EDA. PCA was used to reduce the dimensions of the data before a KMeans clustering alogortithim was applied.
